# Absolute path to the Madara RocksDB directory on your machine.
# This should be the `db/` directory (contains `CURRENT` and `*.sst`), not the base-path itself.
# (If you're using `./scripts/up.sh`, passing the base-path is also fine; it will auto-resolve `<base-path>/db`.)
# Example: /Users/you/.madara/db
ROCKSDB_PATH=

# Optional: name of the RocksDB directory within the mounted base-path.
# Usually this is simply `db`. Only needed if your RocksDB dir isn't literally named `db`.
DB_DIR_NAME=db

# Host ports (optional)
